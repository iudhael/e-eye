# Project Title

E-eye

## Summary

E-eye is a smart electronic glasses project, designed to be affordable and accessible, aimed at improving the quality of life of blind or visually impaired people. Using advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies, E-eye helps users perceive their surroundings, recognize objects and people, and navigate autonomously.


## Background

* Problem to solve: Blind or visually impaired people encounter significant difficulties in their daily lives, particularly in terms of mobility, object recognition and reading texts. These challenges can reduce their independence and quality of life. In addition, existing solutions are often expensive, which limits their accessibility.
* Frequency of the problem: In 2022, according to the World Health Organization, approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from visual impairments. According to AIPC, more than 1.1 billion people were living with vision loss in 2020.
* Personal motivation: This project is a natural extension of my degree project carried out with a friend, which consisted of the design and creation of an intelligent cane to facilitate the mobility of people suffering from blindness or the visually impaired. Our personal motivation is reinforced by our desire to continue this type of project and by the meetings we had with blind and visually impaired people during our visit to a promotion center for blind and visually impaired people. We want to help these people so that they have the same opportunities as us.
* Importance of the topic: This topic is crucial because it touches on human dignity and equal access to opportunities. By providing adapted tools at a reduced cost, we can help blind or visually impaired people live more independent and fulfilled lives.

## Data and AI techniques
### Data sources

* Images and videos captured by cameras integrated into the glasses.
* Databases for object and text recognition.
* GPS data for navigation.

### Useful AI techniques:

* Computer vision: For recognizing objects and faces.
* OCR (Optical Character Recognition): To read and convert text into speech.
* Deep learning: To improve the accuracy of image recognition and interpretation algorithms.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): To interpret and respond to users' voice commands in multiple local languages, making it easier to communicate and use the device.


## How is it used?

* Context of use: E-eye is mainly used in urban and domestic environments. It helps users navigate, read signs, identify objects in stores, and recognize people around them.

* Users: The main people affected by this solution are the blind and visually impaired. However, those around them, such as family members, friends and caregivers, will also benefit from users' increased independence.


## Challenges
### Project limits:

* Light Conditions: The performance of cameras and algorithms may be affected by extreme light conditions.
* Battery life: Battery life may limit prolonged use of the glasses.
* Recognition accuracy: Object and text recognition can sometimes be inaccurate, especially in complex environments.
* Multilingual Support: Managing and updating voice commands in multiple local languages ​​can be a technical challenge.

## What next?
### Evolution of the project:

* Technological improvement: Integrate additional sensors to improve accuracy and reliability.
* Cost reduction: Optimize manufacturing processes to make the device more affordable.
* Feature expansion: Add features like emotion or facial expression recognition for enhanced social interaction.
* Multilingual Support: Develop and integrate voice commands in multiple local languages ​​to facilitate communication and use by a diversity of users.
* Collaboration: Establish partnerships with associations and health organizations to test and improve the device based on user feedback.

## Acknowledgments

* Using open source libraries for computer vision like OpenCV and TensorFlow.
* Inspired by my degree project carried out with my friend, which consisted of the design and creation of an intelligent cane to facilitate the mobility of people suffering from blindness or low vision. Our meeting with blind and visually impaired people in a promotion center was also a great source of inspiration for us.

E-eye aims to transform the lives of blind and visually impaired people by providing them with greater independence and a better quality of life through cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence and computer vision, while being affordable and easy to use . By integrating voice commands in several local languages, we ensure that our device is truly accessible to everyone.
